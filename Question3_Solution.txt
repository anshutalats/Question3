1. Aadhar card no should be mandatory and it should be attach with aestrik sign.Floor and Wing should not be mandate option in address details.
2. we should seperate the form as per the functionalities. For eg 1st page should be personal info, next page should be address info likewise.
3. At the end of the page there is so much extra space and that should not be present in terms of UI Aesthetics and user experience.
4. It should be easy to recall the user interface and how to use it on subsequent visits. So, a good design site means the user should learn from the first time and visit next time just as easily.

   The effectiveness of the system
   Is the system is easy to learn?
   Is the system useful and adds value to the target audience?
